                        Daytrader performance benchmark sample provides a suite of workloads for characterizing performance of 
                        Java EE Application Servers. The workloads
                        consist of an end to end web application and a full set of primitives. The applications are a
                        collection of Java classes, Java Servlets, JavaServer Pages, and Enterprise Java
                        Beans built to open Java EE APIs. Together these provide versatile and portable test cases
                        designed to measure aspects of scalability and performance.

                        DayTrader is an end-to-end benchmark
                        and performance sample application. It provides a
                        real world Java EE workload.<BR> <BR> DayTrader's new
                        design spans Java EE 7, including the new WebSockets specification. Other Java EE features include JSPs, Servlets, EJBs, JPA, JDBC, JSF, JMS, MDBs, and
                        transactions (synchronous and asynchronous/2-phase commit).<BR> <BR> <B>Primitives</B><BR>
